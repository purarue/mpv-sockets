# mpv-sockets

A collection of bash scripts to allow easier and programmatic interaction with `mpv` sockets

When launching `mpv`, one can use `--ipc-socket` (or set the property in your `mpv.conf`) to launch `mpv` with the _one_ socket, but I tend to have lots of instances of `mpv` open. One for a video I'm watching, another for some album I'm listening to, another for a [playlist](https://github.com/purarue/plaintext-playlist)...

If you use the one IPC socket, whenever a new instance of `mpv` is launched, the old instance gets disconnected. The [`mpv` wrapper script](./mpv) creates a unique IPC socket for each `mpv` instance launched at `/tmp/mpvsockets`.

`mpv-active-sockets` removes any inactive (leftover socket files from instances which have been quit) `mpv` sockets, and lists active `mpv` sockets

`mpv-communicate` is a basic `socat` wrapper to send commands to the IPC server. (sends all additional arguments to the socket described by the first argument)

To illustrate:

If I have two instances of `mpv` open:

```bash
$ mpv-active-sockets
/tmp/mpvsockets/1643226338072141025
/tmp/mpvsockets/1643226355764534189
```

To get metadata from the oldest (sockets are sorted by spawn time, so `head` gets the oldest) launched `mpv` instance:

```bash
$ mpv-communicate "$(mpv-active-sockets | head -n 1)" '{ "command": ["get_property", "metadata"] }' | jq
{
  "data": {
    "title": "Roundabout",
    "album": "Fragile",
    "genre": "Progressive Rock",
    "track": "01/9",
    "disc": "1/1",
    "artist": "Yes",
    "album_artist": "Yes",
    "date": "1972"
  },
  "request_id": 0,
  "error": "success"
}
```

`mpv-get-property` interpolates the second argument into the `get_property` `command` syntax, but is practically no different from `mpv-communicate`

```bash
$ mpv-get-property "$(mpv-active-sockets)" path  # this works if there's only one instance of mpv active
Music/Yes/Yes - Fragile/01 - Roundabout.mp3
```

### `mpv-currently-playing`

`mpv-currently-playing` is a `mpv-get-property` wrapper that gets information about the currently playing mpv instance. If there are multiple sockets, prints multiple lines, with one for each socket.

By default that will print the full path of the song that's currently playing, but you can provide the `--socket` flag to print the sockets instead.

Lots of scripts here use `mpv-currently-playing` internally, as interacting with the currently playing `mpv` instance is pretty useful.

- `mpv-play-pause`: toggles the currently playing `mpv` between playing/paused. It keeps track of which sockets were recently paused - if a socket can be resumed, it does that; else, tries to look for another paused `mpv` instance to resume.

- `mpv-song-description`: constructs a description from the `metadata`:

```bash
$ mpv-song-description
Yellow Submarine - The Beatles (Revolver)
```

- `mpv-next-song`: goes to the next song, by sending the `playlist-next` command:

```bash
mpv-communicate $(mpv-currently-playing --socket | tail -n1) '{ "command": ["playlist-next"] }'
```

- `mpv-seek`: moves forward/backward a few seconds in the currently playing media

- `mpv-quit-latest`: quit the currently playing `mpv` instance:

```
mpv-communicate $(mpv-currently-playing --socket | tail -n1) 'quit'
```

To list currently paused `mpv` instances:

`$ diff -y --suppress-common-lines <(mpv-currently-playing --socket) <(mpv-active-sockets) | grep -oP '(\/tmp\/mpvsockets\/\d+)'`

---

I bind lots of these scripts to keybindings, so I can easily play/pause and skip songs without switching to the terminal with `mpv` running; search for `mpv` in my [config file](https://purarue.xyz/d/i3/config?dark)

There are lots of properties/commands one can send to `mpv`, see `mpv --list-properties` and these ([1](https://stackoverflow.com/q/35013075/9348376), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/q/62582594/9348376)) for reference.

## Install

Dependencies: [`mpv`](https://mpv.io/), [`socat`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat), [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), `sed`, ([`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for `mpv-quit-pick`)

To install this, clone and copy all the scripts somewhere onto your `$PATH`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/purarue/mpv-sockets
cd ./mpv-sockets
make
```

That puts them in `~/.local/bin`

I put the directory that the `mpv` wrapper script is installed into on my `$PATH` before `/usr/bin`, so the wrapper script intercepts calls that would typically call the `mpv` binary. In my shell profile, like:

```
PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH
```

You could alternatively rename the `mpv` wrapper script here to something like `mpvs` and then run `mpvs` instead of `mpv` when you want unique sockets.

This checks `/usr/bin/mpv`, `/bin/mpv` and `/usr/local/bin/mpv` for the `mpv` binary. If your `mpv` isn't at one of those locations, you can set the `MPV_PATH` variable in your shell profile;

```
export MPV_PATH=/home/user/bin/mpv
```

You can set the `MPV_SOCKET_DIR` environment variable to spawn sockets in a directory other than `/tmp/mpvsockets`, this uses the `TMPDIR` environment variable if it's set instead of `/tmp`

### Alternative Installation Methods

To automate the manual `git clone`/`cd`/`make`, you could instead use [`bpkg`](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg):

```
bpkg install -g purarue/mpv-sockets
```

Or [`basher`](https://github.com/basherpm/basher):

```
basher install purarue/mpv-sockets
```

Note that in this case the basher `bin` has to appear before the `mpv` binary, see [my config](https://github.com/purarue/dotfiles/blob/50fdef99d8e5343181cc68abe1a9fc0f941a0cad/.profile#L59-L60) as an example (I install basher in `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, by default it places itself in `~/.basher`)

### Daemon

I run [`mpv-history-daemon`](https://github.com/purarue/mpv-history-daemon) in the background, which polls for new sockets at `/tmp/mpvsockets`, grabbing file info, metadata, and whenever I play/pause/skip anything playing in `mpv`. That creates a local JSON scrobbling history for `mpv`, which I send up to [my_feed](https://purarue.xyz/feed/?order_by=when&sort=desc&ftype=listen), as well as to a [websocket-based currently playing server](https://github.com/purarue/currently_listening)
